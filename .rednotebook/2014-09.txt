    time I'm trying out RedNotebook for scientific/documentation purposes.\nI have
    a lot of difficulty using paper journals for this purpose, so I hope that an electronic\nversion
    will be more effective.\n\n===Overview:===\nMost of the work today was spent on
    fixing wiring issues and testing to ensure that the\nsystem was still properly
    grounded and functioned correctly with 120Vac input.\n\n===Tests:===\n====Power
    On:====\n- 1. Mains voltage applied to IEC connector. \n- 2. Confirm that no shorts
    exist upstream of fuse.\n- 3. Connect power to transformer primary\n- 4. Confirm
    again that the fuse is still intact.\n- 5. Power down.\n\n\n===Results:===\nPower
    On Test #1\n====================\n\n- Confirmed that the system does not have
    any shorts.\n\n- Verified correct operation of fuse, transformer, and power switch.\n\n-
    **Transformer Voltage: 28Vac (P-P)**\n=====================\n===Conclusions &
    Recommendations: ===\nThe decision to make the switch from the test soldered connections
    to crimped connectors\nwas a wise decision. The internals are much less likely
    to short and the wiring looks overall\nmuch better and secure than before. \n\nOf
    important note is the use of different gauges of wire. The day's work has made
    me realize\nthat different gauges are required, not only due to diameter, but
    because of flexing and the likelihood\nof flex induced wire damage. When wires
    are carrying Mains voltage, it's of particular importance that\nthey don't get
    fatigued from flexing. I should consider keeping both #22 and #18 gauge wire at
    all times.\n\nThe need for shorter standoffs also presented itself.\n=====================\n**Tags:**

    work has been spent on creating the schematic inside of Proteus.\n\nI am especially
    focusing on the BOM and ensuring that I make a professional grade schematic\nand
    PCB. So, I took time to add proper PCB footprints and parts to the libraries available.\n\n===Work
    Breakdown - ===\n//**Schematic - **//\n- Added the Panasonic caps to the libarary.\n-
    Added the basic full wave rectifier and voltage regulators\n- Decided how I want
    to do schematic notes and how to bond earth ground to secondary\n- Setup PDF workflow
    and tools\n- Added XLR connector and figured out how to show graphics without
    pins in schematic\n\n\nDid calculation of the resistors required. Chose R1=120R
    due to reduced thermal noise.\nFrom this, calculated R2=840R\n===Tests:===\n===Results:===\n===Conclusions
