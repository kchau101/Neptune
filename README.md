An Open Source Ribbon Mic Preamp
Kevin Chau

This is a simple design based on the INA217 Amplifier from TI.
The amplifier section is essentially copied off of page 7 or 8 of the datasheet.
No guarantee of functionality, just what I've been working on
for a personal project. 

If you'd like to use this design, please reference the TI document,
as I don't think this particular implementation will be of any significant contribution
to the work done by TI.

I've left a rednotebook folder for documentation of the process. Read if you'd like.
